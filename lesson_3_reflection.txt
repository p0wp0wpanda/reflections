When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When more than one person is contributing to the same branch

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Changes made by someone else may be buggy.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are GitHub based remote clones. CLones copy a remote repository to a local one. Branches
  operate within a local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Any conflicts arising can be easily resoved and no internet connection is need to see the
  diff between the remote and the local at that point in time.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  Easier to deal with conflicts. Way harder to work with other people.
