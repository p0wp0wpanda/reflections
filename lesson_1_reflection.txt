How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Changes in the code can be seen easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Any mistakes made can be undone.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
	
    Pros :- Better control and easier to read.
	
    Cons :- User error.
		    

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Google docs is probably not going to be edited by more than a few people.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives the id and git diff give the lines which were inserted or deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Comparing between versions with and without the bug help a lot in narrowing down the problem.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Exploring open source and contributing to code bases.
